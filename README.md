By day I am personal trainer at [Austral FitnessÂ®](https://www.australfitness.cl), a Kinesiology student at the [Universidad de Magallanes](http://www.umag.cl) and researcher in the [Austral Chilean Integrative Molecular Neurophysiology group (NIM-ACh)](https://nimach.org). By night an enthusiastic R programmer and web developer (the latter still on progress), with a taste for statistics.

## ðŸ”­ Research

Iâ€™m currently working on sports and exercise physiology research, focused on clinical contexts. You may see my work on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matias-Castillo-Aguilar), [ORCID ![ORCID](https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7291-247X), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s4mqZ9AAAAAJ&hl=es).

## âš¡ Software Development

Software development creating R packages for statistical computing, reproducible research and data science.
  - [`writR`](https://github.com/matcasti/writR), for manuscript-ready statistical computing with assumptions being tested (primarily for group differences).
  - [`dtPipe`](https://github.com/matcasti/dtPipe), pipe-able functions for using with `data.table` objects.
  - [`labinstrumentos`](https://seremictci.github.io/labinstrumentos), processed data from the Instruments Laboratory of the Ministry of Science (Chile), as well as tools for analysis and visualisation.
  - [`rlockdown`](https://matcasti.github.io/rlockdown/), allow users to protect their standalone html files in an easy manner with no server-side comunication.
  - [`mammals`](https://matcasti.github.io/mammals/), tools for population dynamics analysis.
  - [`prices`](https://matcasti.github.io/prices/), helper functions for services prices estimation based on time-dependent work.
  - [`youngSwimmers`](https://github.com/nim-ach/youngSwimmers), data-package with records used in the young elite swimmers [study](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.769085).
